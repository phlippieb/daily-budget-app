# ðŸ¦œ Daily Budget App

A simple iOS budgeting app by Phlippie Bosman

## How it works

The first screen you see when you open the app is the home screen. From here, you can add a new budget or view any budgets you've created.

When creating or editing a budget, you set an amount and a first and last day. The amount is the total for the entire budget period. **Daily Budget** uses the amount and total days to determine your daily allowance. Any unspent amount from this allowance carries over to the next day.

Tapping on a budget opens a detail view for that budget. Here, you will see your daily allowance minus any expenses. You can also add or edit expenses against the budget from this screen.

## Features

## About the app

**Daily budget** was written natively in SwiftUI, using SwiftData to persist its data. It uses no external dependencies.

## Privacy

**Daily Budget** does not collect any data. Information you enter into the application may be synced to your iCloud account.
