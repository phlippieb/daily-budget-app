## 🔍 How it works

The first screen you see when you open the app is the home screen. From here, you can add a new budget or view any budgets you've created.

When creating or editing a budget, you set an amount and a first and last day. The amount is the total for the entire budget period. **Daily Budget** uses the amount and total days to determine your daily allowance. Any unspent amount from this allowance carries over to the next day.

Tapping on a budget opens a detail view for that budget. Here, you will see your daily allowance minus any expenses. You can also add or edit expenses against the budget from this screen.

## 🧘🏻‍♀️ How to use it

**Daily Budget** aims to give you the tools you need to manage and track your budgets as you see fit. That said, here are two strategies you could try to get started:

### Strategy 1: One budget for all day-to-day expenses

1. At the start of the month, or when you start using the app, determine the total amount of money you have available. Optionally subtract any expenses you would not consider "day-to-day", such as bills.
2. Create a budget in **Daily Budget** for that amount that runs until your next payday. The app will allocate a daily amount available for you to use, based on your available amount and the duration of the budget.
3. Log all your expenses against this budget.
4. Try to stay within your daily allowance every day. If you go over budget (for example after a large expense such as grocery shopping), try to spend less on subsequent days until you break even again.

### Strategy 2: Different budgets for different areas

Rather than lumping all your available funds into one budget, and then logging all expenses to this budget, you can create different budgets with different pre-determined amounts. For example, create separate budgets for groceries, clothing, and going out. Decide up-front how much to spend on each.
